# TODO for Zeno Language (Go Implementation)

This file lists planned features and improvements for the Zeno programming language Go implementation and its compiler.

## Recently Completed ‚úÖ

- [x] **TypeScript-style Import System:** `import {println} from "std/fmt"` syntax
- [x] **Import Statement Parsing:** Full parsing and validation of import statements
- [x] **Unused Variable Detection:** Compile-time detection with helpful error messages
- [x] **Import Validation:** Ensures functions are imported before use
- [x] **Multilingual Error Messages:** Japanese error messages with `-jp` flag
- [x] **Binary Expressions:** Mathematical and comparison operators
- [x] **Type Annotations:** Optional type annotations support
- [x] **Generator Restructure:** Struct-based generator with scope tracking
- [x] **Variable Usage Analysis:** Two-pass compilation for proper validation
    - [x] **Print/Println as Functions:** Changed print/println from keywords to regular functions provided by the `std/fmt` module. This involved removing `PRINT`/`PRINTLN` tokens, `ast.PrintStatement`, and related parser/generator logic. All print operations now require importing from `std/fmt`.
- [x] **std/io Module:** File I/O operations with readFile/writeFile functions
- [x] **String Escape Sequences:** Proper handling of \n, \t, \", \\ in string literals
- [x] **Public Function Declarations:** `pub fn` keyword for function visibility
- [x] **User-defined Module System:** Relative path imports (`./`, `../`) with proper path resolution
- [x] **Unused Function Detection:** Compile-time detection (excludes main and public functions)
- [x] **Enhanced CLI Interface:** `run` and `compile` subcommands with improved error handling
- [x] **Type System Foundation:** Complete type system with symbol table and type inference
- [x] **Type-based Conditional Generation:** Smart boolean conversion based on variable types
  - [x] Bool types: Generate as-is (`if y {`)
  - [x] Int types: Generate with `!= 0` conversion (`if (x != 0) {`)
  - [x] String types: Generate with `!= ""` conversion (`if (z != "") {`)
  - [x] Float types: Generate with `!= 0.0` conversion
- [x] **Consistent Main Function Generation:** Always generate main function wrapper for all programs
- [x] **std/io Module Enhancement:** Added `remove` and `pwd` functions.
- [x] **Parser Bug Fix: `return` statement handling:** Resolved issues related to token consumption/state recovery after `return` statements in various block contexts, ensuring robust parsing. (Verified via `test_return_statements.zeno` and `test_std_io_extended.zeno`)

## High Priority üöÄ

## High Priority üöÄ

- [x] **Function Definitions and Calls:**
    - [x] Syntax for defining functions with parameters and return types
    - [x] Parsing function definitions and calls
    - [x] Code generation for user-defined functions
    - [x] Return statements and return type validation
    - [x] Public function declarations with `pub` keyword
    - [x] Function visibility in generated Go code

- [x] **Type System Implementation:**
    - [x] Basic type system with symbol table
    - [x] Type inference from expressions  
    - [x] Variable type registration during let declarations
    - [x] Type-aware conditional code generation

- [ ] **Control Flow Statements:**
    - [x] if statements with type-aware boolean conversion
    - [ ] if/else if/else statements (full implementation)
    - [ ] while loops (Basic implementation might exist, needs verification for completeness)
    - [ ] loop statements with break/continue (Needs verification for completeness)
    - [ ] for loops (Needs design and implementation)
    - [ ] if/else expressions (Allow `if/else` to return values and be used in expressions, e.g., `let x = if cond {1} else {2}`)

- [ ] **Assignment and Mutation:**
    - [ ] Assignment statements (`x = value`) - No semicolons required
    - [ ] Type checking for assignments (Ensuring type compatibility on re-assignment)

**Language Design Note:** Zeno follows a semicolon-free syntax design similar to languages like Python and Ruby. All statements are terminated by newlines rather than semicolons for cleaner, more readable code. The language uses a unified `let`-only variable declaration system for simplicity and consistency.
